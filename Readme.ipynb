    "## Executive Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "    Nine classes of hands gestures were choosen based on the ASL alphabet to be used as proof of concept.  Each gesture would be used to trigger a different action within a separate program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Data was collected from opensource online archive, webcam screen shoot, and cameraphone images of ~ 15 volunteers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The files sizes and proportions that were inconsistent were resized to 412 x 412. \n",
    "    Data augmentaion was performed to grow the quantity of data through roboflow.com.  Augmentation techniques that were utilized: conversion into Black and white, screw, rotation, brightness, and hue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model \n",
    "\n",
    "    The model Tiny YoloV4 on Darknet framework was choosen for the CNN model of choice.  The Tiny YoloV4 model has a weight set of only ~23mb but still returned a 40.2 % AP50 score on MS COCO Object Detection dataset.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "    The model was trained and tuned on Google Colab using the architecture file (cfg) achiving a model with 92.96 mAP. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "    The architecture and weigths files were placed into a OpenCV script, utilizing openCV DNN libaries, to run realtime detection of the gestures through the computers webcam. (detect.ipynb) \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Linked python program\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The python program turtle_test3.py is a python script running events based from turtle.py libaries.  Move-2.txt is a text file that is written to when a gesture is detected.  The turtle_test3.py program is constantly reading this file, waiting for an update which will cause it to execute a function that will change the color and draw a new geometric.\n",

With the low computational cost of running a tiny yolov4 it is able to run on a CPU in real time.  It has also been proven that the detection of particualar hand gestures is able to trigger actions within another program.  \n"

(because most smartphone cameras were used to collect the data, the model expects the hand to be large in comparison to frame size.)\n",

    "We will research concepts of what will the future of computer vision hold. I can see a time when computers will intuite human gestures by passively collecting data from watching us, just as the search engine customizes and intuites our needs based on past searches we have done.  Cameras linked to computer vision systems will be ubiquitous in the future. A computer network will understand your mood & intentions based on gentle shifts in your body language as well, if not better, than your intimate partner or the family dog.  Will this data be centralized on cloud serves or decentralized on personal home servers?  What rules will be in place to keep this data private so that it is not leveraged by employers, goverment, corperate espionage, and advertising companies.    "
